As a Data Scientist seasoned in marketing analysis and project management, I bring strong critical thinking, sharp focus on meeting goals and high aptitude to work well in teams. I experience great personal fulfillment in identifying problems and finding solutions, so I instinctively identify these opportunities in my everyday life. 

I have led teams to create a better customer user experience, reduced project costs by $125K and realized an ROI of 1800% on a win-back marketing campaign. 

With my attention to detail, hunger for learning, and ability to communicate to technical and non-technical audiences, I help companies interpret valuable data to create actionable plans to help achieve/exceed company goals.
